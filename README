               Management system for MySQL deployments
               =======================================

This is a system for managing a farm of MySQL servers.

Installing
----------

You can install the MySQL Fabric from source code using:

    python setup.py install

This will install the `mysql.fabric` package (and all sub-packages), a
command-line script (i.e. `mysqlfabric`) that is used to administer
the farm and a sample configuration file.

The location where the packages, command-line and configuration files
will be installed depends on the operating system and distro being
used. In Ubuntu 12.04, for example, the "/usr/local" path is the base
location.

Running
-------

After installing MySQL, one may execute commands as follows:

    mysqlfabric help commands

On Windows though, a file without extension cannot be executed, so
commands must be executed as follows:

    python <script-dir>/mysqlfabric help commands

The problem does not happen if you install Fabric through a Windows
Installer.  In this case, the script is created as `mysqlfabric.exe`
which can be directly executed. The full path to the script must be
specified as its directory is not automatically added to the `PATH`
variable.

Installation Issues
-------------------

1. Make sure that the python executable is in the path and points to
   the correct version. Only python 2.6 and 2.7 are supported.

2. On non-windows platforms, make sure that the script location is in
   the path. It will not be possible to call it directly otherwise.

3. On windows, make sure that the following associations are defined:

    H:\>assoc .py
    .py=Python.File

    H:\>assoc .pyo
    .pyo=Python.File

    H:\>assoc .pyw
    .pyw=Python.File

    H:\>assoc .pyc
    .pyc=Python.File

    H:\>ftype Python.File
    Python.File="C:\Python27\python.exe" "%1" %*


Documentation
-------------

To build the documentation, one needs to install sphinx which can be done from
PyPI as follows:

    pip install sphinx sphinxcontrib-seqdiag

Then it is necessary to either build or install Fabric and after these steps,
the following command can be used to build the documentation:

    python setup.py build_docs

By default HTML documents are created under the directory build/sphinx.  You may
change the documentation format, the build directory and other options whenever
appropriate. Run the following command to see the list of available options:

    python setup.py build_docs --help

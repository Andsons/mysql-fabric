               Management system for MySQL deployments
               =======================================

This is a management system for managing a deployment of MySQL servers.


Dependencies
------------

To build the documentation, you need to have Sphinx installed. The documentation
also requires adding seqdiag to build. These can be installed from PyPI using:

    pip install sphinx sphinxcontrib-seqdiag

Installation
------------

You can install the MySQL Fabric using:

    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install

This will install the 'mysql.fabric' package (and all sub-packages) and a set of
command-line scripts that are used to administer the fabric.

Documentation
-------------

To build the documentation, one needs to install sphinx and build or install
MySQL Fabric first. After these steps, the following command can be used to
build the documentation:

    python setup.py build_docs

By default HTML documents are created under the directory build/sphinx.  You may
change the documentation format, the build directory and other options whenever
appropriate. Run the following command to see the list of available options:

    python setup.py build_docs --help

Running unit tests
------------------

The package also contain a bunch of unit tests that are used mainly during
development to check that all pieces work correctly. The tests can be executed
using the command:

    python test.py --host=<host> --port=<port> --user=<user> \
    --password=<password> --servers="<servers' addresses>"

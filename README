               Management system for MySQL deployments
               =======================================

This is a management system for managing a deployment of MySQL
servers.


Dependencies
------------

To build the documentation, you need to have Sphinx installed. The
documentation also requires adding seqdiag to build. These can be
installed from PyPI using:

    pip install sphinx sphinxcontrib-seqdiag


Installation
------------

You can install the MySQL Hub using:

    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install

This will install the 'mysql.hub' package (and all sub-packages) and a
set of command-line scripts that are used to administer the hub.


Running unit tests
------------------

The package also contain a bunch of unit tests that are used mainly
during development to check that all pieces work correctly. The tests
can be executed using the command:

    python test.py

               Management system for MySQL deployments
               =======================================

This is a management system for managing a deployment of MySQL
servers.


Dependencies
------------

To build the documentation, you need to have Sphinx installed. The
documentation also requires adding seqdiag to build. These can be
installed from PyPI using:

    pip install sphinx sphinxcontrib-seqdiag


Installation
------------

You can install the MySQL Hub using:

    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install

This will install the 'mysql.hub' package (and all sub-packages) and a
set of command-line scripts that are used to administer the hub.

Documentation
-------------
To build the documentation, one needs to install sphinx and build the
MySQL Hub first. After these steps, the following command can be used
to build the documentation:

    python setup.py build_docs

By default HTML documents are created under the directory build/sphinx.
You may change the documentation format, the build directory and other
options whenever appropriate. Run the following command to see the list
of available options:

    python setup.py build_docs --help

Running unit tests
------------------

The package also contain a bunch of unit tests that are used mainly
during development to check that all pieces work correctly. The tests
can be executed using the command:

    python test.py --host=<host> --port=<port> --user=<user> \
    --password=<password> --servers="<servers's addresses>"

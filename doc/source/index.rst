The MySQL Fabric is a framework for managing a heterogenous collection
of MySQL servers and other components called a *farm*.  In addition to
handling normal MySQL servers, the system can keep an eye on other
components that are necessary to deploy large-scale applications.

The design focus of the system is to be *easy to use*, since it should
be possible to easily use it to deploy a system with a minimum of
special knowledge, but it is also designed to *extensible*.

   
* Move option handling to mysql.hub.options

- Add all default options
   
- Load command-specific options from command module

- Handle that some options overload configuration options

* Support killing hub process using signals

- This requires storing the PID in a pid-file

- Process should accept HUP and shut down cleanly

* Add generation of BAT-files to support Windows

- Currently, we only generate Python scripts for Unices.

- We should also generate BAT scripts for Windows that call the appropriate module

* Fix logger to show submodule logging

- Currently, there is just one logging level, which makes it hard to debug.

- We should set the logger for each module to the module name.
